# Chat With Search

This project implements an intelligent chat and search system using LangChain and Groq API, integrating advanced document retrieval techniques with ArXiv and Wikipedia wrappers. The system leverages LangChain agents to dynamically route queries to the most relevant sources, enabling insightful and accurate responses.
Key Features

ðŸ”¹ Groq API for LLM Interference â€“ Enhances query understanding and response generation.

ðŸ”¹ ArXiv & Wikipedia Wrappers â€“ Retrieves academic and general knowledge articles.

ðŸ”¹ LangChain Agents â€“ Dynamically selects appropriate data sources.

ðŸ”¹ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) â€“ Combines search with LLM responses for better accuracy.

ðŸ”¹ FAISS Vector Database â€“ Efficient document embedding and retrieval for faster search.
